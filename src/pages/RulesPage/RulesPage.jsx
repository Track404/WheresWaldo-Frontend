          <h2>Objective:</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of <strong>Where is Waldo?</strong> is to find Waldo,
            a character wearing a red-and-white striped shirt, blue pants, and
            glasses, hidden somewhere in a detailed, crowded illustration. Each
            page of the book or game contains a scene filled with numerous
            characters and objects, and Waldo is typically tucked somewhere in
            the midst of the chaos. The goal is to spot Waldo as quickly as
            possible.
          </p>

          <h2>Basic Rules:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Starting the Game:</span> Begin with a page or scene that
              contains Waldo (and possibly other hidden characters, objects, or
              items).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Looking for Waldo:</span> Scan the image carefully. The
              images are full of intricate details, and Waldo will always be in
              the image but cleverly hidden.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span>Game Levels:</span> Difficulty increases as the scenes
              become more complex. More people, objects, and distractions make
              it harder to spot Waldo.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span>Winning the Game:</span> The goal is to find all the hidden
              items (including Waldo) within a single round. Once you find them
              all, the time you took to find them will be recorded. The faster
              you complete it, the better your time.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tips for Finding Waldo:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Start by identifying familiar features like Waldo is red-and-white
              striped shirt, glasses, and blue pants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus on smaller sections of the scene rather than scanning the
              entire image at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look for Waldoâ€™s characteristic pose, as he stands out from the
              rest of the crowd.
